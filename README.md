# Creating a development build

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires an android device connected to the laptop and ADB

1. `bun install`
2. `bun run prebuild`
3. `bun run run:android`

(this will create a development apk and automatically install in your device)

> Building an apk

> [!NOTE]
> add `--local` flag if you don't have a Expo EAS account or want to build it locally on your PC\
> add `--output /path/to/file.apk` to save the apk in that path

1. `bun install`
2. `bun install --global eas-cli`
3. `eas build --clear-cache --platform android --profile preview`

This will create an apk but won't automatically install
